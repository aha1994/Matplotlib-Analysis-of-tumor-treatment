Analysis:

From the Tumor Volume over time chart, we see that only two of the drugs (Capomulin and Ramicane) resulted in a
decrease in the tumor volume. All other treatments resulted in an increase in tumor volume. There is overlap in
the errorbars for Capomulin and Ramicane, so one was not significantly better at reducing tumor volume during this
timeframe. 

From the Metastatic Sites over time chart, we see that every treatment group had an increase in the number of sites.
Again, Capomulin and Ramicane treatment resulted in the mice with the lowest number of metastatic sites, along with 
Stelasyn when accounting for the errorbars. 

From the Percent Survival over time chart, we see that once again, Capomulin and Ramicane were the two treatments 
that had the highest survival rate. Both of these drugs ended with a survival rate over 80% while every other treatment
was below 60%. This is reinforced by the bar chart for change in tumor volume over time, where Capomulin and
Ramicane are the only two treatments with a decrease (green) in tumor volume.
